Based on the PydanticAI documentation and your requirements, here's the implementation approach I recommend for your multi-agent marketing system:

## Multi-Agent Architecture

**Primary Agent: Marketing Coordinator**

- Orchestrates the entire social media posting workflow
- Handles user interaction and high-level decision making
- Delegates specialized tasks to sub-agents

**Sub-Agents:**

1. **Image Analysis Agent** - Generates detailed image descriptions
2. **Platform Strategy Agent** - Determines optimal platforms and content strategy
3. **Content Generation Agent** - Creates platform-specific text content
4. **Posting Execution Agent** - Handles credential retrieval and actual posting

## Implementation Flow

### 1. Marketing Coordinator Agent

This main agent will:

- Receive the user's request with image URL
- Validate the image is accessible
- Coordinate between sub-agents in sequence
- Handle error cases and user feedback
- Provide final confirmation of posts

### 2. Image Analysis Agent

**Dependencies needed:**

- Image URL from the coordinator
- Possibly vision model capabilities or image processing tools

**Responsibilities:**

- Generate detailed, marketing-focused image description
- Identify key visual elements, colors, mood, subjects
- Suggest potential marketing angles or themes

### 3. Platform Strategy Agent

**Dependencies needed:**

- Image description from Image Analysis Agent
- User's business context (name, URL, description from system prompt)
- Platform capabilities and best practices knowledge

**Responsibilities:**

- Determine which platforms (Facebook/Instagram) are most suitable
- Consider image format, content type, and business goals
- Provide platform-specific strategy recommendations

### 4. Content Generation Agent

**Dependencies needed:**

- Image description
- Selected platforms from Platform Strategy Agent
- Business context from system prompt

**Responsibilities:**

- Generate platform-optimized captions
- Include appropriate hashtags, mentions, CTAs
- Ensure content aligns with platform best practices
- Consider character limits and formatting

### 5. Posting Execution Agent

**Dependencies needed:**

- Generated content for each platform
- S3 image URL
- Database access for user credentials

**Tools needed:**

- `get_user_facebook_credentials` function
- `get_user_instagram_credentials` function
- `post_image_to_facebook` function
- `post_image_to_instagram` function

**Responsibilities:**

- Retrieve user credentials for selected platforms
- Execute actual posting using your utility functions
- Handle posting errors and provide status updates
- Confirm successful posts

## Key PydanticAI Features to Leverage

**Dependencies System:**

- Pass image URL, business context, and platform selections between agents
- Use typed dependencies to ensure data integrity
- Share database connections and S3 configuration

**Function Tools:**

- Image processing/analysis tools for the Image Analysis Agent
- Database query tools for credential retrieval
- Your existing posting functions as tools for the Execution Agent

**Message History:**

- Maintain conversation context across agent interactions
- Allow user to refine requests or handle errors
- Track the workflow progress

**Result Handling:**

- Use structured results with Pydantic models for inter-agent communication
- Handle success/failure states gracefully
- Provide detailed feedback to users

## Structured Data Models

You'll want Pydantic models for:

- `ImageAnalysis` (description, themes, marketing_angles)
- `PlatformStrategy` (selected_platforms, reasoning, recommendations)
- `PlatformContent` (platform, caption, hashtags, cta)
- `PostingResult` (platform, success, post_id, error_message)

## Error Handling Strategy

- Graceful degradation if image analysis fails
- Fallback content generation if specific platform content fails
- Clear user communication about partial successes
- Retry mechanisms for network-related posting failures

This architecture leverages PydanticAI's strengths in orchestrating multiple specialized agents while maintaining clean separation of concerns and robust error handling. Each agent can be tested independently, and the system can easily be extended with additional platforms or capabilities.

Would you like me to help you implement any specific part of this architecture, or would you prefer to share your existing code for me to adapt?
